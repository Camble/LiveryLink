# Livery Link for DCS World

## Privacy Policy

Last Updated: 6th Sept 2025

### Introduction

`Livery Link` is a desktop application that helps you manage DCS World liveries. This policy outlines how Livery Link handles your data, including its interaction with Eagle Dynamics User Files, Google Drive and Livery Link servers.

### Information We Access

Livery Link's primary function is to download, extract, and install livery and mod files. This data is downloaded directly to your local machine.

Eagle Dynamics User Files: Livery Link can access publicly hosted files from the Eagle Dynamics User Files website.

Google Drive: Livery Link can access publicly hosted files from Google Drive. In order to share privately hosted liveries on Google Drive, Livery Link will request access to your Google Drive. Livery Link will not access any private files without prior instruction from the user.

Livery Link Servers: The application connects to a Livery Link server to facilitate the sharing of livery information. This connection is used to instruct other clients to download content from the original source (e.g., Google Drive or Eagle Dynamics). This process does not involve the peer-to-peer sharing of your personal files or data.

Developer Diagnostics: Livery Link has built-in error reporting and logging. This data includes livery details and is used to further the development of the application and to improve the overall user experience. Logs may also include your DCS World callsign to aid support of any potential issues, but this can be disabled in the user options.

### Google API Services and User Data

Livery Link's use of Google user data adheres to the [Google API Services User Data Policy](https://developers.google.com/terms/api-services-user-data-policy), including its "Limited Use" requirements.

### How We Use Your Data

The data accessed is used exclusively to provide you with the functionality of Livery Link.

The application does not transmit any of your private data or any other personal files, to any external servers.

All file processing, including downloading, extracting, and installing, occurs locally on your computer.

### Data Protection and Security

Livery Link does not collect, store, or transmit any sensitive or personally identifiable information. All user data, including files accessed from your Google Drive, is processed and stored locally on your device. We do not have access to this data.

Any and all data required for Livery Link to function is stored locally. This includes the Google API token, which is stored on the user's machine and is not transmitted to or stored on any external servers. Any temporary data is stored locally on your machine and is subject to the security of your own device.

We do not collect or store any personal information from you, with the exception of your DCS World callsign if you enable developer diagnostics.

### Data Deletion

You have full control over the files on your system. You can delete any files downloaded by the application at any time. If you have enabled the Google Drive feature, you can revoke our application's access at any time by visiting the "Third-party apps with access to your account" section in your Google Account settings. Once access is revoked, our application will no longer be able to interact with private liveries shared with you via Google Drive.

You can also opt out of the developer diagnostics feature at any time through `Tools > Options`.

### Changes to This Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new policy on our website or within the application.
