# Livery Link

> Note: From v0.22.0, releases of Livery Link will include a zipped folder to make installation easier. If you are on v0.19.0 or earlier, you will need to manually update to the newer version before the auto-updater will handle this new folder structure.

## Requirements

- .NET 8 is required to run Livery Link. You will be prompted to install it if you don't already have it.

## About

Livery Link's purpose is twofold:
- A desktop application to simplify downloading, installing & managing DCS Liveries.
- An automatic livery sharing mod for DCS.

## How Does It Work?

- Liveries must be installed with Livery Link to be shared.
- When you connect to a server which has Livery Link running, your client will connect.
- When you take off, your current livery will be shared with other players.
- When another player shares a livery with the server, your client will download and install it automatically.


## Installation

1. Extract all contents into the folder of your choice.
1. Run `LiveryLink.exe` to initialize the app.
1. Locate your `Saved Games\DCS` folder if prompted.
1. Choose `Yes` to install the scripts.


## Livery Sharing

In order to automatically share liveries to other players, they must also have Livery Link, and the server you are flying on must be running Livery Link Server.

The server will be made available for DCS server hosts with the v1.0 release. Pre-release is available for Patreon supporters.


## Recent Changes

### 0.22.0

- Feature: Delete Livery from within the new right-click context menu.
- Feature: Drag an image into the Livery Link window to use it as a thumbnail for that livery. Ideal for local files, which only display the default thumbnail.
- Improvement: When attempting to resolve which aircraft a livery is for and there are multiple matches (i.e. A10A, A10C, A10CII), check if there is one single installed module. If so, use this. Otherwise, the selection dialog will only display the possible modules.
